# Data Visualization Project
Data Visualization using **Looker** Software.
## Project Overview
### Description
This is a personal project for learning purpose. In this project, Looker software is used for the visualization of Data regarding Airports and Flights, i.e., **FAA**(Federal Aviation Administration). Looker is a cloud-based Business Intelligence (BI) tool that helps you explore, share, and visualize data that drive better business decisions. Looker is now a part of the Google Cloud Platform. It allows anyone in your business to analyze and find insights into your datasets quickly.
### Challenge scenario
- Which states and cities have the most airports with heliports?
- What is the facility type breakdown for the states with the most airports?
- What are the airports and states with the highest percentage of flight cancellations with over 10,000 flights?
- Where are the busiest, joint-use major airports that have control towers and what are their associated codes?
- What are the origin and destination airports with the smallest average distance between them?
## Implementation
### Task 1:
Look #1: Top 5 Cities With Most Heliports.
- A table with three columns: **City**, **State**, and **Airports Count**
- Limit the results (rows) to the top **5** states
- The Airports Count column should be in descending order (most to least)
- Filter for the Facility Type = **Heliports**

Result:
